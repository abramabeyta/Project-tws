China has a problem with websites that don't promote their government, this could be solved by having web designers create websites that do normal things, while promoting the Chinese government at the same time.
Some primary sources are the Chinese government website and World studies, Some secondary sources are magazine websites or news websites.
Some solutions that exist are vpns, dns servers, and mirror websites.
My website will give chinese citizens potential ways to freely browse the interent.
